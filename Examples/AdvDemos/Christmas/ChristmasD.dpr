(* GLScene Christmas "ScreenSaver".

   Won't save your screen from anything though ;)
   If placed in Windows\System32 directory you need also to copy data there

   The scene is made up from a few meshes, some GLScene objects, several
   lens-flares and particle effects components, and a 2 text. BASS is used
   for the sound part (3D positionned fire loop, and mp3 playback).
   Wrapped gifts appear around christmas every year.

   Assembled from bits from the web, should be royalty free, but I don't have
   the means to check... so if you have clues about any of them:

   Models: from 3DCafe.com
   Textures: various origins, some from 3dtextures.fr.st, others made by Eric Grange
   Music: unknown origin, was in a "royalty free" download package
