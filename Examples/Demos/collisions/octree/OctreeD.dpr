{: Octree raycast/mesh sample.
   Demonstrating how to find the intersection point between eye-screen ray
   and a high poly mesh with an Octree property.

   To see the performance difference:
  -move mouse around on the scene with octree disabled (default)
   -check the "octree enabled" box.  Note the frame-rate difference.
