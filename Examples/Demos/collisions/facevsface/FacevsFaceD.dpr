   This sample illustrates:<ul>
   <li>collisions between FreeForm Objects (Triangle-based)
   <li>collisions between Cubes
   <li>basic user-driven camera movements.
   <li>picking Objects
   <li>moving Objects
   </ul></li>

   Usage:<ul>
   <li>left Mouse will move Camera
   <li>right Mouse will move an object
   <li>left Mouse + shift will roll and pitch the object
