GLScene for Win32/Win64

-------------------------------------------------------

GLScene is an OpenGL based 3D library for Delphi, C++Builder and Lazarus. 
It provides visual components and objects allowing description and effective rendering of 3D scenes.
GLScene is not only an OpenGL wrapper or utility library, but it's grown to become a set of founding classes 
for a generic 3D engine for the Rapid Application Development. 
GLScene allows you to design and render 3D scenes quickly and without having to learn the intricacies of OpenGL: 
if you know how to design a TForm, you'll easily master the basic operation of TGLScene. 
Make sure to checkout the introduction tutorial included in the help folder.
GLScene includes more than many components and a variety of founding classes. 
The library comes with a comfortable set of demos showcasing the ease of use and demonstrating RAD wasn't done 
at the expense of CPU horsepower. 
The GLScene Sound System allows positional 3D audio via low-level APIs like 
FMOD, BASS, OpenAL and WaveOut.
Advanced demos and samples could be found in the project directory GLScene\Examples.
Some additional options for compiler are in GLS.Scene.inc (activated/deactivated, all are inactive by default):
The option DEFINE GLS_Graphics32_SUPPORT controls support Alex Denissov's Graphics32 library 
(http://www.graphics32.org), once activated will redirect assignments from 
TBitmap32 to TGLBitmap32.
