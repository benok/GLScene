# GLScene

GLScene is a graphics engine based on OpenGL and VCL components for Delphi & C++ Builder.
It provides the class library and tools for rendering 3D scenes with spatial objects, 
free forms and virtual smart actors.  
Additional components are being developed for meshing, gridding, 
lacing with shaders, audio and physics applications
